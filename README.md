This is the code repo for the paper *AceSearcher: Bootstrapping Reasoning and Search for LLMs via Reinforced Self-Play* (NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight).

---

## üìå Overview
**AceSearcher** is a framework that unifies **reasoning** and **search** for large language models (LLMs) via **reinforced self-play**.  
Our method bootstraps LLMs‚Äô ability to solve multi-hop reasoning tasks by jointly training decomposer and solver modules with supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning stage. 

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ritaranx/AceSearcher.git
cd AceSearcher
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Generation 
Most of the data generation used in AceSearcher is in `rollout` folder. The description for files are listed as belows:
- `rs_mhqa.py` |  `rs_cot.py` | `rs_pot.py`: [Step 1] the rollout pipeline for multi-hop QA, chain-of-thought, and program-of-thought datasets.
- `create_training_pairs.py`: [Step 2] the process for filtering & selecting preference pairs in mDPO iterations. 
- `create_dpo_pairs.py`: [Step 3] the process of curating the final preference pairs for reinforcement finetuning

## Evaluation
- For QA / Fact Verification Datasets:
    - Use `decompose_vllm.py` to first decompose the data.
    - Use `main_qa.py` to generate the final answer.
- For Document-level Financial Reasoning Datasets:
    - Use `main_reasoning.py` for evaluation.


## Data Directories
- Put corpus and embeddings in `embeddings/{dataset}/`. We use the wikipedia dump for `hover`, `exfever` and `bamboogle` datasets while using the script in [IRCOT](https://github.com/StonyBrookNLP/ircot) repo for getting the corpus for `hotpotqa`, `2wikimhqa` and `musique`. 
- The training data should be in `train_data` folder as `f"train_data/{dataset}/train.jsonl"`.
- The processed data after rollout are in `processed_data/{dataset}/train.jsonl`. 
- The data used for mDPO finetuning will be put in `processed_data/mdpo/` folder.
- The evaluation data is put into `./eval_datasets` folder.

## Model Usage
For question decomposition on QA tasks: 
```
prompt_plan_qa = """Please break down the question "{question}" into multiple specific sub-questions that address individual components of the original question. 
Mark each sub-question with ### at the beginning.  If you need to refer to answers from earlier sub-questions, use #1, #2, etc., to indicate the corresponding answers.
Decomposed Question:"""

prompt_qa = prompt_plan_qa.replace("{question}", question)

prompt = [
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt_qa.strip()}
] 

text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    prompt,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    enable_thinking=False
)

outputs = llm.generate([text], sampling_params)
generated_text = outputs[0].outputs[0].text
```

For question decomposition on fact verification tasks: 
```
prompt_plan_claim = """Please break down the claim "{claim}" into multiple smaller sub-claims that each focus on a specific component of the original statement, making it easier for a model to verify.
Begin each sub-claim with ###. If needed, refer to answers from earlier sub-claims using #1, #2, etc.
Decomposed claim:"""

prompt_plan_claim = prompt_plan_claim.replace("{question}", question)

prompt = [
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt_plan_claim.strip()}
] 

text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    prompt,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    enable_thinking=False
)

outputs = llm.generate([text], sampling_params)
generated_text = outputs[0].outputs[0].text
```

For question answering for subquestions:
```
prompt = f"""You have the following context passages:
{context_text}

Please answer the question '{sub_q}' with a short span using the context as reference.
If no answer is found in the context, use your own knowledge. Your answer needs to be as short as possible."""
```

For fact verification tasks for subquestions:
```
prompt = f"""You have the following context passages:
{context_text}

Please verify whether the claim '{sub_q}' is correct using the context as reference. 
If no answer is found in the context, use your own knowledge.
Please only output Yes or No and do not give any explanation."""
```

For question answering to generate the final answer:
```
prompt = f"""You have the following passages:
{passages}

You are also given some subquestions and their answers:
{sub_answer_text}

Please answer the question '{original_question}' with {final_prompt} using the documents and subquestions as reference.
Make sure your response is grounded in documents and provides clear reasoning followed by a concise conclusion. If no relevant information is found, use your own knowledge. 
Wrap your answer with <answer> and </answer> tags."""
```

For fact verification tasks to generate the final answer:
```
prompt = f"""You have the following passages:
{passages}

You are given some subquestions and their answers:
{sub_answer_text}

Please verify the correctness of the claim: '{original_question}' using the subquestions as reference. Please provide a concise and clear reasoning followed by a concise conclusion. Your answer should be Yes or No only. 
Wrap your answer with <answer> and </answer> tags."""
```

For Decomposition for document-level financial reasoning tasks:
```
decompose_prompt = """You have the following passages and table:\nPassages:\n{passage}\nPlease break down the question '{question}' into multiple specific sub-questions that address individual components of the original question, with the table and passages as the reference. Use ### to mark the start of each sub-question."""

qa_prompt = """You have the following passages and table:\nPassages:\n{passage}\nFor the question '{question}', here is a referenced breakdown:\n{decompose}.\n\nWrite a Python program to solve the question. Store the final result in the variable ans."""

## Training
We use [Llama-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/) codebase for both SFT and RFT (mDPO) finetuning. Please see `config` folder for the example configs used.
